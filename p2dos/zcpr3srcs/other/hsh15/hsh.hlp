HSH Line Editing
:Description

HSH is a history processing ZCPR3 shell.  It provides the ability
to recall and edit previous commands and allows much more
sophisticated editing than is found in the normal CP/M or ZCPR3
command processor.
:Running HSH.

HSH is run with the command

          hsh

One operand, the number of history lines to keep may be included, e.g.,

          hsh 50

If no number is included, the number of history lines from the current
history file, or a default of 10 if there is no history file, will be used.

Specifying a number clears the history file.

beginning of a line:

     <ESC> -   (Escape key).  Exit HSH.

               CP/M or ZCPR3 ^C.
