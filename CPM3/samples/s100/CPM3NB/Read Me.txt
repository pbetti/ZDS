Remember the .REL files are BANKED=FALSE Files here.
To use them for Banked Systems they need to be 
Re-assembled with BANKED=TRUE

You can speed up some of the assemblies for seldom
changed modules by using the .REL files but be very
careful not to get the Banked and non-banked .REL
files mixed up. They both have the same names!
