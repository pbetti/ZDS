                        INTRODUCTION

This entry is intended to give you on-line information about your
your dBASE II Database Management System.  It explains the disk 
files you have received, and gives suggestions on tapping the  
power now available to you for data management.  Using the on-
line HELP in conjunction with your Manual, you will soon be  
creating databases and writing command procedures to do your 
work.

                HOW TO USE THE 'HELP' FACILITY

Information about your dBASE II system can be obtained by typing
HELP and the name of a dBASE II command and any of the following 
key words: 

        DBASE        ERRORS     FULL SCREEN    FUNCTIONS    
        GLOSSARY     HELP       INSTALL        LIMITS    
        NEW          RUNTIME   

>Note: Only the first four letters of the command or key word is
needed.

dBASE will then look up the entry for the key word and display 
it.  If there is no information on the subject, then dBASE will 
say "No help messages found".  When there is more text to display  
than what is shown, you will see the word WAITING (like this).


          >>>>>>> type any key to continue <<<<<<<

The  essential  dBASE II files  on  this disk are:

DBASE.COM    -- main system program file
DBASEOVR.COM -- overlay file and system messages
DBASEMSG.TXT -- this HELP file (only necessary if you use HELP)

*EXIT
*INSTALL
In order to use dBASE II's full screen editing capability, your
terminal must be properly installed.  Many dBASE formats are pre-
installed.  If yours is not, your screen will appear jumbled when 
you attempt to perform such full screen operations as APPEND and 
EDIT.  To correct this, you must install dBASE II by running the 
installation program, INSTALL.COM or INSTALL.EXE.  Refer to your 
Manual for complete instructions on running the install program. 
Since you may diagnose your terminal's status at any time by 
running STARTUP.PRG  (called from the dBASE II "." prompt by 
entering the command DO STARTUP),  you would be wise to use it
before attempting to INSTALL dBASE II.  It will tell you if you 
need to run the installation program, and can be used later to 
check the results if you do.
*EXIT

*HELP
               dBASE II ON-LINE HELP FACILITY

Below you will find a list of all dBASE commands.  Each entry in 
this list corresponds to an entry in the HELP file.  In the 
latter, you will find a brief synopsis of each command along with
its correct  syntax.  Please remember, however, that HELP file
information is limited, and is only meant to cut down on the 
number of trips you will have to make to the dBASE II Manual.  

To access the entry for the dBASE command (or other Help File 
entry) you wish to review, simply respond to the dBASE  "." 
prompt by entering HELP <name of command> and a return (e.g. HELP 
CREATE <cr>).  dBASE will access the information you wish to see, 
and then return you to the "." prompt so you can go right back 
to work.  In some cases the entry will take up more space than is 
provided by a single screen.  (This is one of them.)  To bring up 
the next screen of information,  just hit any console character: 
this will tell dBASE to stop "Waiting." 


If you wish to exit the HELP file before viewing an entire entry, 
simply hit ESCape.

     in both.  Primary area is active upon bringing up dBASE and 
     after issuing a CLEAR. 

Syntax: SELECT PRIMARY/secondary
*EXIT
*SET
> SET -- Sets dBASE control parameters.  All SET commands are 
     listed below in alphabetic order.  NOTE that some SETs are 
     of the ON/OFF type,  and others require some user option to
     be given.  The default value of the ON/OFF SET commands is
     in uppercase.  
 
Syntax: SET <parameter> [ON/OFF]
        SET <parameter> TO <option>

Example: 

  SET BELL [ON/off] - default value is ON.

> SET ALTERNATE [OFF/on] -- ON sends all screen output (except 
     full screen) to an ASCII file.  (Must be preceded by SET 
     ALTERNATE TO <file>).  OFF suspends output to the file.

> SET BELL [ON/off] -- ON rings when invalid data is entered or 
     data field boundary is reached.  OFF stops ringing.

> SET CARRY [OFF/on] -- ON repeats data in current record from 
     previous record when using full screen mode of APPEND or 
     INSERT.  OFF leaves record blank.

     variables in full screen displays.  OFF stops the display of 
     the colons.

> SET CONFIRM [OFF/on] -- ON disables automatic skipping to next 
     field when current field is filled while in full screen 
     mode.  OFF requires a <return> to be entered before        
     advancing to the next field.

> SET CONSOLE [ON/off] -- ON sends all output to screen.  OFF 
     suspends all output to screen.  System will appear dead.

> SET DEBUG [OFF/on] -- ON sends output created by ECHO and STEP 
     options to printer.  OFF sends this output to the screen.


> SET DELETED [OFF/on] -- ON causes certain dBASE commands to 
     ignore records that are marked for deletion.  Specifically, 
     FIND and most commands that allow a scope are affected.  The
     exceptions are COPY, REPLACE and SUM which always ignore 
     deleted records.  OFF causes these commands to acknowledge 
     all records.

> SET ECHO [OFF/on] -- ON causes commands to be displayed before 
     being executed.  Used in command files as a debugging tool.
     OFF executes the command without displaying it.

> SET EJECT [ON/off] -- ON causes REPORT command to perform a 
     form-feed (page eject) before sending report output to the
     printer.  OFF disables the page eject.

> SET ESCAPE [ON/off] -- ON allows user to abort execution of 
     command file by hitting ESCape key.  OFF disables ESC key 
     interrupt.


> SET EXACT [OFF/on] -- ON requires exact matches in character 
     string comparisons.  OFF allows matches between character 
     strings of different lengths.  The string that is fewer 
     characters in length should be on the right side of the 
     comparison operator.  For example, 'ABCDEF'= 'ABC'. 

> SET INTENSITY [ON/off] -- ON allows the use of reverse video 
     or dual intensity in full screen operations (if allowed by 
     hardware).  OFF disables these features. 

> SET LINKAGE [OFF/on] -- ON causes movement of record pointers 
     in both PRIMARY and SECONDARY areas by commands which allow
     a <scope> (i.e. downward movement only).  OFF causes 
     pointers to move independently of one another.

> SET PRINT [OFF/on] -- ON sends all output of all commands 
     (except full screen commands) to the printer.  OFF stops 
     printer output.


> SET RAW [OFF/on] -- ON DISPLAYs and LISTs records without any
     spaces between the fields, and allows the display of semi-
     colons.  OFF displays a space between fields.

> SET SCREEN [ON/off] -- ON allows the use of the full screen
     for commands such as APPEND, EDIT, and READ.  OFF disables 
     full screen operations.   

> SET SPACE ON/off -- ON will not allow the display of a numeric
     field to begin in column zero using the ? command.  OFF
     allows numeric fields to start in column zero.  Has no 
     effect on REPORT FORM.

> SET STEP [OFF/on] -- ON aids debugging of command files by 
     halting execution after dBASE performs each command.  OFF 
     does not halt execution.

> SET TALK [ON/off] -- ON sends results of command  execution  to 
     screen. OFF suppresses additional screen output.

> SET ALTERNATE TO [<file>] -- Creates and opens a disk file with
     a .TXT extension for recording screen output.  SET ALTERNATE 
     TO without a file name closes the alternate file.  Use in 
     conjunction with SET ALTERNATE ON/off.

> SET COLOR TO <n1,n2> -- Sets color or CRT attribute of terminal 
     output on IBM PC, TI Professional, and IBM PC compatible 
     terminals.  <n1> indicates desired color or attribute of 
     dim/reverse video, <n2> the desired color or attribute of 
     normal display.  
  
> SET DATE TO <xx/xx/xx> -- Stores a string to system date, but 
     does not perform date validation. 

> SET DEFAULT TO <drive> -- Causes dBASE to look on the specified
     drive when instructed to look for files.

     key with the 'new value'.  Operation on the IBM PC, TI
     Professional, Victor, and IBM PC compatible terminals.   

> SET FORMAT TO <SCREEN/print> -- SCREEN sends output of @...SAY 
     commands to screen.   PRINT sends formatted output to the
     printer. 

> SET FORMAT TO [<format file>] -- Opens .FMT file which dBASE 
     will use to format screen for READ, APPEND, EDIT, and INSERT
     commands.  SET FORMAT TO closes any open .FMT file.

> SET HEADING TO <cstring> -- Saves <cstring> internally and 
     prints it as the header line on subsequent REPORT FORMs.

> SET INDEX TO <index file list> -- Sets up index files for use 
     with corresponding database.  Up to seven files may be in 
     the list.  The first file will be the active index, and all
     other index files will updated only.

> SET MARGIN TO <n> -- Sets left hand margin of printer to <n> 
     columns.
*EXIT
*SKIP
> SKIP [<n>] -- Causes the record pointer to be advanced or 
     backed up relative to its current position.  <n> can be 
     either positive or negative.  Its default value is +1.
*EXIT
*SORT
> SORT --  Builds a new copy of the database file in use with all
     records arranged in order according to the specified field.  
     Uses ASCII value to determine the order (e.g. spaces, 
     numbers, uppercase, lowercase, then symbols).  Deleted 
     records are ignored by SORT. The default order is ASCENDING.

Syntax: SORT ON <field> TO <file> [ASCENDING/descending] 
       
Example: 
  . USE MAILLIST
  . SORT ON ZIP TO MAILZIP DESCENDING    
*EXIT
*STORE
> STORE -- Evaluates an expression and saves its result to a
     memory variable.

Syntax: STORE <exp> TO <memvar>

Example: 
  
  . STORE 3 to NUMBER
  . STORE NUMBER + 9 TO NUMBER2
  . STORE 'HOWARD' TO NAME
*EXIT
*SUM
> SUM -- Computes and displays the sums of up to five numeric 
       fields of the database in use and optionally save the
       results as memory variables.  Default value of <scope> is
       ALL non-deleted records. 

Syntax: SUM <exp list> [<scope>] [TO <memvar list>]
                       [FOR/WHILE <exp>]

*EXIT
*TEXT
*ENDTEXT
> TEXT -- In command files, allows the output of text information 
     without the use of @...SAY or ?.  dBASE will read everything 
     as text until it encounters an ENDTEXT command.

Syntax: TEXT
        <text>
        ENDTEXT
*EXIT
*TOTAL
> TOTAL -- Creates a summary version of an indexed or sorted
     database by copying only records with a unique key field
     value.  The key field must be the field on which the file is
     indexed or sorted.  Records with duplicate are combined.  
     All records with the same key field can have their numeric 
     fields totaled in the TO database by using the FIELDS 
     option.  If no ON phrase is used, the entire file will be
     reduced to a single record in the TO file.

Syntax: TOTAL [ON <key field>] TO <file> [FIELDS <field list>]
              [FOR/WHILE <exp>]
*EXIT
*UPDATE
> UPDATE -- Allows batch update of an indexed (or sorted if 
     RANDOM is not used) database by drawing information FROM the
     designated database.  Keys of records in USE and FROM 
     databases are compared for a match.  dBASE can then ADD the
     corresponding numeric fields of two files together.  It can 
     also REPLACE character or numeric fields of USE database 
     with the contents of corresponding fields of the FROM file.  
     Unless the RANDOM option is used, the FROM file must be pre-
     sorted on the key field.

Syntax: UPDATE FROM <file> ON <key field> [ADD <field list>]
               [REPLACE <field list> [WITH <field list>]]
               [RANDOM]
*EXIT
*USE
> USE -- Specified the database file and index files that are to 
     be used for all subsequent operations.  USE automatically  
     closes the previous file in USE in the same work area, so 
     that USE with no file name will close this file in the 
     currently selected work area.  The INDEX option engages up
     to seven index files.  The first is the controlling index 
     that determines the order and is used with FIND.  The rest
     are only updated.  

Syntax: USE <file> [INDEX <index file list>] 
*EXIT
*WAIT

     string.




> CHR -- CHR(<numeric exp>) -- Number to character function 
     yields the ASCII character equivalent of the numeric 
     expression.  For example, CHR(27) is an ESC and CHR(7) rings
     the bell.  Useful in sending control characters to the 
     printer.

> DATE() -- Date function returns the system date as a character 
     string in the format xx/xx/xx.

> EOF -- End-of-file function evaluates as True if an attempt is
     made to go past the last record in a database file.  

> FILE -- FILE(<file>) -- File existence function evaluates as 
     True if the file exists, and as a False if it does not.

Macro is not a character string -- Variables expanded by a macro 
     (&) must of character type.  DISPLAY MEMORY will reveal
     memory variable types.

More than 5 fields to sum - An attempt was made to SUM more than 
     five expressions.  Use multiple SUM commands to get past 
     this limitation.

More than 7 index files selected -- An attempt was made to SET 
     INDEX TO or USE more than seven index files which is the 
     maximum number allowed.

Nesting limit violation exceeded -- Cannot have more than sixteen 
     command files open at once.


No expression to sum -- A SUM command was issued without any
     expressions.

No FOR phrase -- An attempt was made to do a JOIN without a FOR
     clause.  Rewrite the command with the correct syntax.

No FROM Phrase -- An attempt was made to do an UPDATE without a
     FROM clause.  Rewrite the command with the correct syntax.

No find -- A diagnostic message that is displayed when dBASE 
     cannot FIND a key.  Record # will be set to 0.  Suppress 
     this message with SET TALK OFF.

No help messages found -- An attempt was made get HELP when the 
     file DBASEMSG.TXT is not on the disk.

Non-numeric expression -- An attempt was made to SUM a character
     or logical field or expression.


Not a dBASE II database -- An attempt was made to USE a file that
     does not qualify as a dBASE II database.

ON phrase not found -- An attempt was made to do an UPDATE or an
     INDEX without an ON phrase.  Rewrite the command with the
     correct syntax.

Out of memory for memory variables -- A maximum of 1536 bytes is
     available for storing memory variables.  Due to the method 
     with which the buffers are maintained, this number could be
     slightly less.  

Record length exceeds maximum size (of 1000) -- An attempt was 
     made to CREATE a file with more than 1000 characters per
     record.  Reduce the size of some fields or create a second 
     database with a common key.

Record not in index -- Records were added to the database file 
     without the index file being engaged.  REINDEX the file.

Record out of range -- Record number was called that is greater 
     than the number of records in the database or one of its 
     index files.  Either COPY or REINDEX will usually correct
     the problem.

Source and destination data types are different -- An attempt was
     made to REPLACE a field with a value that is not the same 
     data type.  DISPLAY STRUCTURE and DISPLAY MEMORY will reveal
     the types of fields and memory variables.  Some conversion
     functions may be needed.

 ** Syntax error *** -- A dBASE II command line has been 
     improperly constructed.  

Syntax error in format specification -- @ SAY GET PICTURE command 
     is improperly set up.

Syntax error, re-enter -- An entry error was made during INPUT, 
     ACCEPT or REPORT.  These commands require syntactically 
     correct entry.  May expect a different data type.
 
TO phrase not found -- A command that expects a TO phrase has 
     been issued without the inclusion of the TO phrase.  Usually
     happens with STORE or SET commands.

Too many characters -- Command line limit or some other buffer
     limit has been exceeded.  

Too many files are open -- Only 16 files of all types (Command, 
     database, index, format, etc.) may be open at one time.

Too many memory variables -- There is a maximum of 64 active  
     memory variables.

Too many returns encountered -- Probably an error in the 
     structure of a command file.   Check the number and location 
     of RETURNs.



Unassigned file number -- Internal error.  Contact Ashton-Tate 
     for support.  May occur if disks are swapped without 
     properly closing files.

 ** Unknown command -- A command was entered from the dot prompt 
     or from a command file that is not a dBASE II command verb.

Variable cannot be found -- An attempt was made to access a field
     that does not exist.  Check the file structure for the 
     correct spelling of the field name.

WITH phrase not found -- The WITH phrase was left out of a 
     REPLACE command.
