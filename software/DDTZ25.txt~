     Introduction:
     ============
        DDTZ v2.5 is a  complete replacement  for DDT,  Digital  Research's
     famous  Dynamic Debugging Tool,  with improved functionality,  bug ex-
     termination, and full Z80 support.  In general,  DDTZ is fully compat-
     ible with the original utility, but it has extra and extended commands
     and many fewer quirks.  All Z80-specific instructions  can be (dis)as-
     sembled, though in Intel rather then Zilog format.  Furthermore,  DDTZ
     will correctly trace ('T' and 'U' commands) both 8080 and Z80 instruc-
     tions,  depending on which CPU is operating.  On startup,  the program
     announces which CPU it is running on.

        The program is invoked by typing

		ddtz<ret>
     or
       		ddtz [d:]filespec<ret>

     In  the second form,  DDTZ will load  the specified file  into  memory
     starting at 0100H,  unless it's a .HEX file that sets its own load ad-
     dress.  Besides reporting the  NEXT  free address and  the PC (program
     counter) after a successful load, DDTZ also shows the number of memory
     pages needed for a  SAVE.  Instead of  having to write  all this down,
     just use  the 'Q' command  at any time to redisplay these three values
     for the current application.

        As in DDT,  when a program is loaded above the area holding the 'A'
     and 'L' (and now 'K') command code,  these commands are disabled,  and
     the extra memory  is released to the user.  Thus,  DDTZ can occupy  as
     little as 3K total memory space.  Unlike DDT,  however,  DDTZ will not
     overwrite itself or the system on program loads (except .HEX files).

        At initialization,  the stack pointer  (SP)  points to  a return to
     DDTZ,  just like for the CCP.  Thus,  programs that normally return to
     the CCP will be returned to DDTZ.  The 'B' command  reinitializes this
     condition.

        The intercept vector copies  the BDOS version number,  etc.,  so an
     object program  does not know that  DDTZ is running  (except for BIOS-
     BDOS vector size). Thus, programs that check the version number should
     execute correctly under DDTZ.

        All input parameters can now be entered in any of three formats:

	    (1) hexadecimal (as in DDT),
	    (2) decimal, by adding a leading '#' character,
	    (3) ASCII, by enclosing between either single or double quotes;
		either one or two characters are allowed.

        Leading blanks in command lines are absorbed.   Either a comma or a
     (single) space  is  a valid delimiter.   Either uppercase or lowercase
     input is accepted.

        The default command  (for anything  not otherwise recognizable)  is
     'H'. This allows convenient calculation, along with the other features
     described below.  So, to convert a number, just enter it!

        As in DDT,  the prompt character is '-', and the only error message
     is the query ('?'), which generally kicks you back to command mode.
      

     New Commands (Over DDT):
     =======================

     	@   Sets or shows (with no parameter)  the internally stored "base"
	    value.  Also used with the 'S' and 'D' commands  as an optional
	    parameter  (though without the '@')  to display memory  from an
	    arbitrary base marker (offset). When set to zero (the default),
	    it does not affect any screen displays.

	B   B)egin:   resets  the USER stack pointer  to its initial value,
	    such that any program that exits by an RET will return to DDTZ.
	    DDTZ provides  a default stack space  of approximately 24 bytes
	    for user programs.
     
     	C   C)ompare first_address,last_address,against_address:  shows all
	    the byte differences between two memory areas, in the format

		XXXX aa YYYY bb

	    where  XXXX and YYYY  are the comparative memory addresses, and
	    aa  and  bb  are the corresponding byte values.  Can be used to
	    verify  the identity  of two files  by first loading them  into
	    different memory areas with the 'R' command (see below).

	K   K)eep:  stores the modified memory area to disk under the file-
	    name  specified by  the 'I' command,  overwriting  the original
	    file from which it was loaded (the user is queried before doing
	    so).   By default,  the image of memory from 0100H  through the
	    "NEXT" value -1 is saved.  "K first_address,last_address" over-
	    rides this and allows writing ANY memory area to a file. Almost
	    a necessity for CPM 3.0 (no SAVE!).

	Q   Q)uery:  redisplays the "NEXT PC SAVE" report at any time.

	W   W)here first_address,last_address,value: searches the specified
	    memory area for the value (a 16-bit word, not a byte) and shows
	    the locations of all such.  Very useful for finding  CALL's  or
	    JMP's to a particular address, etc.

	Y   Y)our_option parm1,parm2,address: executes an arbitrary routine
	    at the specified address,  with the BC and DE registers  set to
	    parm1 and parm2, respectively.

	Z   Displays (but does not alter) the Z80's alternate register set,
	    including the index registers (disabled if running on an 8080).
	    On Z80's,  automatically included  as the last part of the dis-
	    play by the 'X' command.


     Based (Offset) Displays:
     =======================
 
        The 'D' and 'S' commands  can use a stored base value (offset),  as
     set by  the '@' command.  The current @ value  may be overridden for a
     single execution of these commands by adding the base as an extra par-
     ameter  in the command line.  The effect is  to add this value  to the
     first/last address and display accordingly. The address listing on the
     left becomes  XXXX:YYYY,  where XXXX is the offset address and YYYY is
     the actual memory address being displayed.  For example, if you have a 
     data area  located at  42B7H  and wish to  preserve easy access,  just
     enter "@42b7".  Now, "d0,3f" will dump memory starting at 4237H.


     Further Changes from DDT:
     ========================

     	A   A)ssemble now accepts  the full Z80 as well as 8080 instruction
	    set, although it expects them in Intel rather than Zilog format
	    (see notes below  under  the 'L' command).   When in doubt, try
	    poking in the hexcode (with the 'S' command) and then  L)isting
	    to see what the (dis)assembler recognizes.

	D   D)isplay or D)ump  will accept  an optional third parameter  to
	    set the base value for a single execution only. Format has been
	    cleaned up.

	H   H)ex_arithmetic  on two values  also shows  their difference in
	    decimal. With only one value, converts to hexadecimal, decimal,
	    and ASCII (low-order byte only).

	I   I)nput now allows drive specification  (d:...)  and sets up the
	    complete  command line,  including  the  second FCB  at address
	    006CH on.  Note that the filename may be in lowercase.

	L   L)ist now displays the raw hexcode, especially handy when exam-
	    ining non-code areas. Intel (8080 style) mnemonics are used, so
	    some disassembled instructions may look a little strange. E.g.,
	    the Z80's 'IN B,(C)' and 'OUT (C),B'  become  'INP B' and 'OUTP
	    B', respectively;  'LD (nnnn),BC' becomes 'SBCD nnnn', 'ADD IX,
	    BC' becomes 'DADX B', and 'JP (IX)' becomes 'PCIX'.

	R   R)ead  now permits  loading a file into memory  with an offset,
	    which  is added  to  the default load address  of 0100H.   When
	    reading in  a .HEX file  with  a preset bias,  the  'R' command
	    will not transfer control to an invalid execution point.   Ano-
	    ther execution of the  'R' command  will reread the input file,
	    e.g.:

		i blah<ret>
		r<ret>
		...modify the code and generally mess about...
		r<ret>

	    The original file  is reloaded,  and the modifications  are re-
	    moved.

	S   S)ubstitute  or S)et,  like D)isplay,  now accepts  an optional
	    second parameter  to set the base value  for a single execution
	    only.

	T   T)rap/trace  on termination  now shows  the complete CPU state.
	    Traps and traces no longer lock up  when  a user RST 7 instruc-
	    tion is executed.  Tracing of BDOS/BIOS calls  is heavily trun-
	    cated, avoiding clutter and preventing system crashes.

	X   eX)amine also shows  what two-byte values  the HL and SP regis-
	    ters are actually pointing to. On Z80's, displays the alternate
	    register set.

     NOTE:  Any use of the 'K' or 'R' command  resets the system DMA trans-
	    fer address to the standard default value of 0080H.
