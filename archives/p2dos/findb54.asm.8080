;	     NON-DESTRUCTIVE DISK TEST PROGRAM

;FINDBAD will find all bad blocks on a disk and build a file
;named [UNUSED].BAD to allocate them, thus "locking out" the
;bad blocks so CP/M will not use them.

;*							*
;*			  NOTE				*
;*							*
;*   This program has been re-written to allow it to	*
;* work  with (hopefully)  all CP/M 2.x systems, and	*
;* most 1.4 CP/M systems. It has been tested on sev-	*
;* eral different disk systems, including Northstar,	*
;* Micropolis, DJ2D, and  Keith  Petersen's 10 MByte    *
;* hard disk system.  I have tested it personally on	*
;* my "modified" Northstar, under several  different	*
;* formats (including >16K per extent), and have ob-	*
;* no difficulties.					*
;*  If you have have difficulties getting this	pro-	*
;* gram  to run, AND if you  are using CP/M 2.x, AND	*
;* if  you  know  your CBIOS  to be  bug-free, leave	*
;* me a message on the CBBS mentioned below ... I am	*
;* interested in making this program  as "universal"	*
;* as possible. 					*
;*  I can't help with any version of CP/M 1.4, other    *
;* than  "standard" versions  (whatever that means),	*
;* because there are just too many heavily  modified	*
;* versions available.					*
;*  One  possible  problem you may  find is with the	*
;* system tracks of your diskettes...if they are  of	*
;* a  different density  than the data	tracks, then	*
;* see the note regarding the "SYSTST" equate.		*

;
;SYSTST and BADUSR options:
;  Many double-density disk systems have single-density system
;tracks.  If this is true with your system, you can change the
;program to skip the system tracks,  without re-assembling it.
;To do this, set the byte at 103H to a 0 if you don't want the
;system  tracks tested,  otherwise leave it 1.   This is  also
;necessary if you have a "blocked" disk system;  that is, when
;the same physical disk is seperated into logical disks by use
;of the SYSTRK word in the disk parameter block.
;   If you are a CP/M 2.x user, you may assign the user number
;where  [UNUSED.BAD] will be created by changing the  byte  at
;104H  to  the  desired user number.   If you want it  in  the
;default user,  then leave it 0FFH.  CP/M 1.4 users can ignore
;this byte altogether.
;
;Note that these changes can be done with DDT as follows:
;
;		A>DDT FINDBAD.COM
;		-S103
;		103 01 0	;DON'T TEST SYSTEM TRACKS
;		104 FF F	;PUT [UNUSED.BAD] IN USER 15

;
;04/10/81 Changed extent DB from -1 to 0FFH so program can be

;
;			Using the Program
;
; Before  using this program to "reclaim" a diskette,  it  is
;recommended that the diskette be reformatted. If this is not
;possible,  at least assure yourself that any existing	files
;on the diskette  do not contain unreadable  sectors.  If you
;have changed disks since the last warm-boot, you  must warm-
;boot again before running this program.
;
; To  use the program,	insert	both the disk containing  the
;program  FINDBAD.COM and the diskette to be checked into the
;disk drives. It is possible that the diskette containing the
;program is the one to be checked. Assume that the program is
;on drive "A" and the suspected bad disk is on drive "B".  In
;response to the CP/M prompt "A>",  type in FINDBAD B:.  This
;will  load the file FINDBAD.COM from drive "A" and test  the
;diskette  on  drive "B" for  unreadable  sectors.  The  only
;allowable  parameter  after  the  program name  is  a	drive
;specification	(of the form " N:") for up to four (A  to  D)
;disk drives.  If no drive is specified, the currently logged
;in drive is assumed to contain the diskette to check.
;
; The  program first checks the CP/M System tracks (0 and 1),
;and  any  errors here prohibit the disk from being  used  on
;drive	"A",  since all "warm  boots" occur using the  system
;tracks from the "A" drive.
;
; The  program next checks the first two data blocks  (groups
;to some of us) containing the directory of the diskette.  If
;errors  occur	here,  the  program  terminates  and  control
;returns  to  CP/M  (no other data blocks are  checked	since
;errors in the directory render the disk useless).
;
; Finally,  all  the remaining data blocks are	checked.  Any
;sectors  which  are  unreadable cause the data  block	which
;contains them to be stored temporarily as a "bad block".  At
;the end of this phase,  the message "XX bad blocks found" is
;displayed (where XX is replaced by the number of bad blocks,
;or "No" if no read errors occur).  If bad blocks occur,  the
;filname [UNUSED].BAD is created, the list of "bad blocks" is
;placed  in  the allocation map of the	directory  entry  for
;[UNUSED].BAD,	and the file is closed.  Note,	that when the
;number of "bad blocks" exceeds 16,  the  program  will  open
;additional  extents  as  required  to	hold the overflow.  I
;suggest that if the diskette has more than  32 "bad blocks",
;perhaps it should be sent to the "big disk drive in the sky"
;for the rest it deserves.
;
; The  nifty part of all this is that if any "bad blocks"  do
;occur, they are allocated to [UNUSED].BAD and no longer will
;be available to CP/M for future allocation...bad sectors are
;logically locked out on the diskette!
;
;
;	       Using the TEST conditional assembly
;
;A  conditional  assembly has been added to allow  testing  this
;program  to  make sure it is reading all sectors on  your  disk
;that  are accessible to CP/M.	The program reads the disk on  a
;block by block basis, so it is necessary to first determine the
;number of blocks present.  To start, we must know the number of
;sectors/block (8 sectors/block for standard IBM single  density
;format).  If  this  value  is	not  known,  it  can  easily  be
;determined  by saving one page in a test file and interrogating
;using the STAT command:
;
;	A>SAVE 1 TEST.SIZ
;	A>STAT TEST.SIZ
;
;For standard single-density STAT will report this file as being
;1k.  The file size reported (in bytes) is the size of a  block.
;This  value  divided  by 128 bytes/sector  (the  standard  CP/M
;sector  size)	will  give sectors/block.  For	our  IBM  single
;density example, we have:
;
;  (1024 bytes/block) / (128 bytes/sector) = 8 sectors/block.
;
;We  can now calculate blocks/track (assuming we know the number
;sectors/track). In our example:
;
;  (26 sectors/track) / (8 sectors/block) = 3.25 blocks/track
;
;Now  armed with the total number of data tracks (75 in our  IBM
;single density example), we get total blocks accessible:
;
;  75 (tracks/disk) x (3.25 blocks/track) = 243.75 blocks/disk
;
;CP/M cannot access a fractional block, so we round down (to 243
;blocks  in  our  example).  Now  multiplying  total  blocks  by
;sectors/block	results in total sectors as should  be	reported
;when TEST is set TRUE and a good disk is read. For our example,
;this value is 1944 sectors.
;
;Finally,  note that if SYSTST is set to 0,  the sectors present
;on  the  first  two tracks must be added in  as  well.  In  the
;previous  example,  this  results in  1944 + 52 = 1996  sectors
;reported by the TEST conditional.
;
;Run the program on a KNOWN-GOOD disk.	It should report that it
;has read  the	correct number of sectors.  The test conditional
;assembly should then be set FALSE and the program re-assembled.
;The test routines  cannot be left in  because this program does
;not read all the sectors in a block that is found to be bad and
;thus will report an inaccurate number of sectors read.

;	The BIOS call is necessary in order to

;	(2.x) to find the sector translate table.
;	The BDOS call is necessary to keep CP/M
;	in step with the  BIOS...we may later
;	have to create a [UNUSED].BAD file, and
;	CP/M must know which drive we are using.
